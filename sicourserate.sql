We think of Google, Facebook, EBay, and the Internet as our own personal assistants that help us answer questions, make decisions, or buy goods and services. We happily use all these tools and interact with people near and far and never really think much about how or why things work the way they work. Is there a reason, logic or science behind EBays bidding scheme or Facebook&amp;#039;s privacy policies? How and when does a VouTube video go viral? How can we understand and take advantage of connected thinking, where the group has more intelligence than any one of us alone? How do Netflix and Amazon predict what you might be interested in seeing or reading or buying? How does Internet search and advertising work and who is making money advertising on the Internet? How might you maximize your blog post&amp;#039;s position in Google&amp;#039;s search results? Why do people volunteer to work on Wikipedia without being paid?

The techniques learned in this course can be applied to understanding friend systems like Facebook, recommender systems such as Digg, auction systems such as Ebay, and information webs used by search engines such as Google.  This course introduces two conceptual models, networks and games, for how information flows and is used in multi-person settings.  Networks or graph representations describe the structure of connections among people and documents.  They permit mathematical analysis and meaningful visualizations that highlight different roles played by different people or documents, as well as features of the collection as a whole.  Game representations describe, in situations of interdependence, the actions available to different people and how each person&amp;#039;s outcomes are contingent on the choices of other people.  It permits analysis of stable sets of choices by all the people (equilibrium&amp;#039;s).  It also provides a framework for analysis of the likely effects of alternative designs for markets and information elicitation mechanisms, based on their abstract game representations.  Assignments in the course include problem sets exploring the mechanics of the models and essays applying them to current applications in social computing.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC121'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Theories of Social Influence&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Theories of Social Influence --- This course is a writing-intensive course that introduces some of the major theories of social influence in psychology and economics so that you may become a better decision architect and effective leader.

Products are more successful when they are developed through a process that identifies how the products will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the product function in real time with real users.  This course provides a hands--on introduction to methods used throughout the entire evaluation process--from identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it, engaging users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a product&amp;#039;s function through usability testing and summative evaluation.  Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis, observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and task analysis.

For the purpose of the course, a community is defined as a group of people who sustain interaction over time.  The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions.  An online interaction environment is an electronic forum, accessed through computers or other electronic devices, in which community members can conduct some or all of their interactions.  We will use the term eCommunity as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions. There will be two main treads that weave through the course, based on the two main texts.  One tread will be concerned with the practical issues of design and use of online tools to support communities, and how choices that must be made in design can impact the function and style of the resulting community.  The second thread will focus on the sociological theory that provides a frame to better understand communities in general.  These theoretical pieces will provide a lens for better understanding the implications of choices made on the more practical level.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC147'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">530</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Principles in Management&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Principles in Management --- This course provides a foundation in management for information professionals interested in working in for-profit or non-profit organizations.

Where as the second course focuses on the challenges and innovations in democratic administration, this first course focuses on theories and practices of democratic politics -and the shifting role of information technologies in supporting, transforming, and understanding these.  The first half of the course seeks to ground contemporary discussion around IT and politics in various flavors of democratic and political theory.

The first part of the course sets contemporary discussions of digital &amp;quot;E-government&amp;quot; against a richer backdrop of administrative, bureaucratic, and organizational theory.  The second part of the course explores a range of cases in which emergent informational forms and practices have entered -- and in some cases, begun to alter -- the traditional art and practice of government.

We will explore three main types of infrastructures:  transportation, electric power, and communications/information systems. The course draws out structural similarities and differences among the systems that are the foundation of the industrialized world.  For example, transportation infrastructures face their most difficult problems at the interface between different transport modes, as in ports (where shipping connects with trucking and rail) and airports (where air transit connects with automobile, truck, bus, subway, train, pedestrian, and other modes).  These intermodal problems in transport systems have significant analogies in information infrastructures, where data conversion (from analog to digital, or from one digital format to another) creates difficult problems for system designers and users.  The course explores theoretical concepts such as &amp;quot;technological momentum&amp;quot; (the tendency of large technical systems to become increasingly resistant to change), &amp;quot;load factor&amp;quot; (maximizing the use of available system capacity), and &amp;quot;gateways&amp;quot; (sociotechnical components that connect dissimilar elements of infrastructure).&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC155'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">39</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">542</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Introduction to Health Informatics&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Introduction to Health Informatics --- This course introduces students to the concepts and practices of health informatics.

These developments range from online storage of traditional documents, such as medical information and property records, to new areas of potential concern, such as social networking and data mining.  The course examines theory, history, law, policy, and technology -- as well as approaches taken by other nations -- in its study of contemporary privacy issues, the questions and potential problems that they raise, and the consideration that must be part of addressing them in meaningful ways.

Our primary focus is the social, political, and cultural contexts of post-1939 digital computers and computer networks.  We explore such topics as: A design for a stem-powered, mechanical computer in Victorian England. How early computers cracked the Nazi Enigma cipher during the World War II. How the Cold War changed computers -- and how computers changed the Cold War. Why digital computing replaced well-developed analog methods in the 1940s and 1950s. Computing in Europe, the Soviet Union, and the developing world. How hackers helped shape minicomputers and the Internet. How amateur hobbyists invented the personal computer. The story behind the World Wide Web. This course makes the argument that new technologies and their social effects evolve together along a variety of dimensions.  Some of these are technical:  innovation, design, and opportunity.  Some are social:  funding sources, societal values, and organizational structures.  Still others are macro-scale economic, political, and social forces. The major questions that motivate our study of computers will concern &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; issues.  Why were computers invented?  Who wanted them, and for what purpose?  How have computers changed the shape of society and culture -- and how did society and culture shape them?

Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding user&amp;#039;s information needs and use.  In many cases the data we need to access is distributed online among many webpages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file.  Often these data (e.g. web server logs) are too large to obtain and/or process manually.  Instead, we need an automated way of gathering the data, parsing it, and summarizing it, before we can do more advanced analysis.  In this course students will learn to use Perl and its modules to accomplish these tasks in a &amp;#039;quick and easy&amp;#039; yet useful and repeatable way.

Thus, even when incentives are &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot; with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions.  Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system.  But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge. The first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies.  Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools.

The responsibility is &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; because appraisal comes first in the sequence of archival functions and thus influences all subsequent archival activities, and its &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; in importance because appraisal determines what tiny silver of the total human documentary production will actually become &amp;quot;archives&amp;quot; and thus part of society&amp;#039;s collective memory.  The archivist is thereby actively shaping the future&amp;#039;s history of our own times. This course begins with the theoretical foundations of appraisal and the controversial responsibility of assigning cultural value to some documentary artifacts and not others, within a broader context of history and memory.  Sessions on the evolution of appraisal thinking, and different appraisal experiences, in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia, follow.  With this background, the course will focus on examples from the real world of appraisal strategy and methodology, including electronic records.  Attention will be paid to personal and private records as well as government and institutional ones.  The class will end by trying to apply the theories and methodologies through group projects to various recording media and functional areas of records creation, these reflecting student interests.

The tools, methodologies, and analytic strategies are primarily those of history and the interpretive social sciences - sociology, anthropology, communication, and cultural psychology, in the disciplinary terms. The first part of the course explores the history and historiography of information.  Topically, it addresses the emergence of information technologies from writing and the book to modern media, computing, and the internet.  Theoretically, it explores debates around historical causation, trajectories, periodization, evidence, and the cultural framing and reception of information technologies and practices.  The second part of the course draws selectively on the literatures of qualitative sociology, anthropology, cultural psychology, and the information sciences to explore a range of contemporary information phenomena:  open source communities, online identities, creativity and play, distributed knowledge enterprises, mobile and ubiquitous computing, the semantic web, etc.  The longer term goal of the course is to build a more solid, rigorous, and creative foundation for the social study of information by drawing on promising theoretical and methodological approaches developed in the social sciences at large.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC206'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">649</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Information Visualization&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Information Visualization --- The rise of the Information Age and the ascendancy of computer graphics come together in the area of information visualization, where interactive graphical interfaces reveal structure, extract meaning, and navigate large and complex information worlds.

We encounter it in our everyday lives in the form of E-mail, newspapers, television, the Web, and even in conversations with each other. Information is hidden in a variety of media: text, images, sounds, videos. While casual information consumers can simply enjoy its abundance and appreciate the existence of search engines that can help them find what they want, information professionals are responsible for building the underlying technology that search engines use. Building a search engine involves a lot more than indexing some documents -- information retrieval is the study of the interaction between users and large information environments. It covers concepts such as information need, documents and queries, indexing and searching, retrieval evaluation, multimedia and hypertext search, Web search, as well as bibliographical databases. In this course, students go over some classic concepts of information retrieval and then quickly jump to the current state of the art in the field, where crawlers, spiders, and hard-of-hearing personal butlers roam.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC208'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">92</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">651</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Physical Treatment Processes for Preservation Administrators&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Physical Treatment Processes for Preservation Administrators --- This course introduces students to the artifactual nature of books and papers, and associated concepts of permanence and deterioration, provides an overview of the principles of the conservation of paper-based materials, and discusses the application of those principles to developing preservation policy and working with professional conservators.

Their book was (and still is) called Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, and its authors are widely regarded as the &amp;quot;founding fathers&amp;quot; of IA.  Or at least, IA as it came to be understood and practiced by the people who designed and built the first few generations of large scale websites and intranets. With the dawn of the Web 2.0 era and a rising tide of web design practitioners embracing a broadly-shared identity under the umbrella concept of User Experience Design, perspectives on the role and definition of IA continue to evolve. This course is designed to teach students the core principles of information architecture, provide opportunities to apply and push back on those principles in a variety of realistic contexts, and develop - as much as we can in a single term - a broad understanding of the world of IA work and the diverse opportunities to do it (or sound smart talking about it) in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC215'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">99</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">663</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Entrepreneurship in the Information Industry&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Entrepreneurship in the Information Industry --- Prepares students to start businesses in the information industry or to work effectively in new start-up businesses.

We cover basic-and intermediate-levels of systems&amp;#039; command languages that students put into practice in weekly lab assignments.  Students learn how to choose controlled vocabulary for online searches using print and online thesauri, subject headings lists, and other controlled lists and determine when to augment it with non-controlled terms, that is, the terms that authors and other subject specialists writing in a discipline use to discuss its important concepts and ideas.  Initially we focus on the database structure and search functionality of Boolean-based retrieval systems.  Using this foundation, we transition to how retrieval works in non-Boolean systems such as web search engines and online systems that perform relevance ranking of retrievals.  In assignments and projects, students explore the database structure, functionality, and specialized features of the scholarly databases available through library gateways and brief fellow students in an oral presentation or poster session.  Search strategies are a focus throughout the semester.

Thus, even when incentives are &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot; with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions.  Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system.  But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge. The first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies.  Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools.  The second goal of this course is to clarify how these results can be leveraged to create original and more effective systems and institutions that meet the designer&amp;#039;s goals.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC232'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">116</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">721</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Data Mining:  Methods and Applications&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Data Mining:  Methods and Applications --- With the explosive growth of information generated from different sources, in a variety of formats, and with various qualities, information analysis has become challenging for researchers in many disciplines.  Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets.  This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining.  The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems.  The course will highlight the practical applications of data mining instead of the theoretical foundations of machine learning and statistical computing.  The course materials will focus on how the information in different real world problems can be represented as particular genres, or formats of data, and how the basic mining tasks of each genre of data can be accomplished using the state-of-the-art techniques.  To this end, the course is not only suitable for doctoral students who are doing research in data mining related fields, but also for those who are consumers of data mining techniques in their own disciplines, such as natural language processing, network science, human computer interaction, economics, social computing, sociology, business intelligence, and biomedical informatics, etc.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC233'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">117</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">724</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Qualitative Methods&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Qualitative Methods: The purpose of this seminar is to examine, critique current research employing, and begin to utilize a variety of qualitative methods.

We will explore three main types of infrastructures:  transportation, electric power, and communications/information systems. The course  draws out structural similarities and differences among the systems that are the foundation of the industrialized world.  For example, transportation infrastructures face their most difficult problems at the interface between different transport modes, as in ports (where shipping connects with trucking and rail) and airports (where air transit connects with automobile, truck, bus, subway, train, pedestrian, and other modes).  These intermodal problems in transport systems have significant analogies in information infrastructures, where data conversion (from analog to digital, or from one digital format to another) creates difficult problems for system designers and users.  The course explores theoretical concepts such as &amp;quot;technological momentum&amp;quot; (the tendency of large technical systems to become increasingly resistant to change), &amp;quot;load factor&amp;quot; (maximizing the use of available system capacity), and &amp;quot;gateways&amp;quot; (sociotechnical components that connect dissimilar elements of infrastructure).&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC238'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">122</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">742</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Current Concepts and Case Studies in Health Informatics&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Current Concepts and Case Studies in Health Informatics ---&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></div><div class='line' id='LC239'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">courses</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">745</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Information Use in Communities&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Information Use in Communities --- This course provides an opportunity for students to examine information seeking and use in geographic communities.
